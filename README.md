READ Notes repository
===

I am beginning that repository to delivery notes and summaries of books I am reading.

I am personally very bad on memorizing everything, so I wanted to keep notes to make it easier to come back and remember what I read.
It will take some time to add notes, but I will try to go chapter by chapter and keep the books I read as pull request in the same projects.

The book topics are mostly technical, some very well known by the community (`Clean Code`, `Clean architecture`, etc.), but I don't want to make it close to others.

All the notes should be the same format:

- Title and author
- About the author section (with link to wikipedia maybe?)
- few lines/paragraphs for each chapter of the book
- Conclusion
- Maybe some interesting links to follow up
